## Requirements
- PupilCore headset
- computer with Pupil Capture installed
- access to a 3D Printer and a 2D (paper) Printer
- 4 coil springs of about 5mmm diameter and 15mm length (or similar)
   
         
1. Print out the Clips-3D-Prints/ClipsCompleteSet.stl file on a 3D printer.

2. Each clip is composed of 2 3D-Prints and a spring. Position the 3 components as shown in the pictures below, making sure the spring is seated properly in the holes of both 3D-printed parts, and press the two 3D printed parts together around the hinge, so that they lock into place with a click. If your springs don't fit properly into your 3D printed parts, adjust the 3D-models of the clips in a 3D-modelling program (such as [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)).
3. Print out (on paper) the AprilTagsPrintout.pdf file. Cut out 4 different AprilTags from the piece of paper. They should have an edge length of 16mm-17mm. Paste the paper AprilTags on the 3D-Prints as shown below, observing which of the different AprilTags goes on which 3D-Printed clip, as well as the orientation of the AprilTags.
